## Climbing Destination: 500 meters

--

### You are gifted with a magic toolkit of genetic engineering to alter the expression pattern of any of my over 15,000 genes. 

--

### Your goal is to increase my chance to find when and where your genetic engineering tools work magically so that a large number of my metabolites change and I can also locate these metabolite changes. 

&lt;br/&gt;

--

#### We may generalize your goal to the following one.

--

&lt;i&gt;If you have magic tools to change a set of my components (I call this set as A) in different parts of my body, which component in A in which part of my body you want to pick so that it is more likely to answer when and where a large number of components in my other set (I call this set as B) will be most susceptible to your tools, compared to other components in A you do not pick? &lt;/i&gt;

---
## Get Started

--

### Let us clear-cut your goal! Just disregard the previous slide.

--

- ü™∞: I want to see a number of changes in my metabolites (not just one metabolite) following your genetic engineering. 

--

- ü™∞: I want to know in which part of my body I can see a number of changes in my metabolites after your genetic engineering.

--

- ü™∞: I also want to know when and where you can make me see these changes. So, which gene(s) in which part of my body during which period of my life cycle do you want to engineer?

---
## Climbing Height: 100 meters

--

ü™∞: Click [me](http://flymet.org/met_explore/pathway_explorer) to investigate what metabolic pathways are in my body.

--

ü™∞: Can you find which metabolic pathway is enriched with the highest number of metabolites?

--

- `Gluconeogenesis`, which is associated with `25` metabolites, as you can see in the following table.

## ü™∞: So, do you get which gene(s) in which part of my body during which period of my life cycle can be engineered so that a number of metabolites in which part of my body are expected to change? 

---

class: center, middle

## ü™∞: How do you feel after climbing to 500 meters? Do you want to go up, like 1000 meters?

---

class: center, middle

## ü™∞: Let us propose questions you will encounter on your journey to 1000 meters. Are you ready?

---

class: center, middle

## ü™∞: Do you want to question the data quality? 

---

class: center, middle

## ü™∞: Do you want to refine when and where in your engineering procedures more precisely? XXX days after fertilisation? XXX cells in head? 

---

class: center, middle

## ü™∞: Do you want to substitute A in the generalized version of your goal as the non-coding gene set {gene 1, gene 2, gene 3, ...gene n}, and B as the metabolite set {metabolite 1, metabolite 2, metabolite 3, ...metabolite n}?

## ü™∞: Do you want to examine how genes that appear not to show any association with any metabolic pathway in the database do not relate to metabolism or actually do relate to metabolism?
